We describe the design, deployment and testing of a module to
track and graphically represent user movement in a collaborative
virtual environment. This module allows for the comparison of
ground-truth user/observer ratings of the affective qualities of an
interaction with automatically generated representations of the
participants’ movements in real time. In this example, we generate
three charts visible both to participants and external researchers.
Two display the sum of the tracked movements of each participant,
and a third displays a “synchrony visualizer”, or a correlation
coefficient based on the relationship between the two participants’
movements. Users and observers thus see a visual representation of
“nonverbal synchrony” as it evolves over the course of the
interaction. We discuss this module in the context of other
applications beyond synchrony.
